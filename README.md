## ⚙️ How the Application Works

1. User enters a task in the input field  
2. Clicking the **Add** button creates a new list item dynamically  
3. Clicking on a task toggles the completed state  
4. Clicking the ❌ icon deletes the task  
5. Tasks are stored in **LocalStorage**, so data persists after page refresh
